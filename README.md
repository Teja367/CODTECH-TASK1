 #Automatic Street Light Circuit (Tinkercad Simulation)

The automatic street light circuit is a simple yet effective project that uses basic electronic components to control street lighting based on the surrounding light intensity. In this Tinkercad simulation, the primary components include an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), an Arduino UNO, a relay module, resistors, and an LED or bulb to simulate the street light.

The LDR senses the ambient light levels. When it gets dark, the resistance of the LDR increases, causing a voltage drop that is detected by the Arduino. The Arduino is programmed to turn ON the street light (represented by an LED or relay-driven bulb) when the LDR reading falls below a certain threshold, simulating night-time conditions. Conversely, during daylight, the light intensity increases, and the Arduino turns OFF the street light.

This circuit is energy-efficient, cost-effective, and ideal for outdoor lighting automation. It eliminates the need for manual switching, ensuring that street lights operate only when needed. In Tinkercad, users can simulate varying light conditions by adjusting the LDR values, observing how the system responds in real-time. This project demonstrates the practical application of sensors and microcontrollers in smart city infrastructure.
